# Flutter Testing Sample 
## Example of Unit testing & Integration testing & Widget testing in Flutter

**Unit tests are handy for verifying the behavior of a single function, method, or class. 
The test package provides the core framework for writing unit tests, and the flutter_test package provides additional utilities for testing widgets.
“unit” is another name for a function, method, or class**


_Automated testing falls into a few categories:

A unit test tests a single function, method, or class.
A widget test (in other UI frameworks referred to as component test) tests a single widget.
An integration test tests a complete app or a large part of an app._
